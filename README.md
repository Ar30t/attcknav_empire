# attcknav_empire 

Note: attcknav_empire is forked version of https://github.com/dstepanic/attck_empire.

Attcknav_empire worked with latest version of powershell-empire including starkiller version.

# Overview
Generate ATT&CK Navigator layer files (JSON) based on PowerShell Empire modules used during red team/pentesting engagements.  The modules are pulled from each host's agent.log file and mapped to one or more ATT&CK techniques.  This can be used as a learning tool for handoffs between red/blue teams as well as part of a final pentest report.

Please note the layer generation portion (gen_layer.py) was developed by the 
[MITRE ATT&CK team](https://github.com/mitre/attack-navigator/blob/master/layers/attack_layers/attack_layers_simple.py) and slightly modified in order to output JSON file. A spreadsheet (Empire_modules.xlsx) is included that contains the technique/module mapping for any custom modifications.

# Using the script
1. Perform red team engagement using PowerShell Empire, generate agent.log files by compromising hosts and using different modules.

2. Run main Python script (attcknav_empire.py) in Powershell Empire downloads folder or point to specific agent.log file:<br /><br />
python attcknav_empire.py (Searches within sub-directories for agent.log files)<br />
python attcknav_empire.py -a C:/tmp/agent.log

3.  View layer file by using MITRE's hosted instance of ATT&CK Navigator or spin up your own environment:<br /><br />
MIRE Hosted - https://mitre.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise/<br />
Internal Instance - https://github.com/mitre/attack-navigator<br />

*Please note, the Navigator hosted instance by MITRE stores and utilizes layer files on the client-side, not server-side. For any 
internal/sensitive data, it's recommended to use your own instance.*

4. Click on the plus sign on top left corner of ATT&CK Navigator page, select "Open Existing Layer" and choose your generated layer file (JSON).
